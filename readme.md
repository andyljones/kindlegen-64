[Here's the download link you're after](https://github.com/andyljones/kindlegen-64/raw/master/kindlegen).

This is a mirror of Amazon's 64-bit kindlegen, [extracted from Kindle Previewer 3](https://www.literatureandlatte.com/forum/viewtopic.php?p=284621#p284621). Unlike the independently-downloadable [32-bit kindlegen](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/feature.html?ie=UTF8&docId=1000765211&sa-no-redirect=1) this works on OSX after Mojave/10.14.
